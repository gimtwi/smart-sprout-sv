# Smart Sprout server

## What do I need?

Make sure you have the following frameworks installed on your machine:

- [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) OR [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation)
- [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download)
- [mongodb](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/administration/install-community/)
- [compass](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/compass/master/install/)

## How do I get this running?

After cloning the repository, run in terminal of the project directory:

- Connect MongoDB in Compass by clicking on `Connect`.
- `npm i` OR `pnpm i`
- `npm run sv` OR `pnpm sv`

After this you should be able to access the server on `http://localhost:4000/graphql`
